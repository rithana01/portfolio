### Projects
### Predictive Modeling for Telco Customer Retention
## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in the telecom industry using **machine learning, deep learning, and unsupervised learning techniques**. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of **33 variables and 7,043 observations**, covering customer demographics, service details, and churn factors.

## üöÄ Techniques Used

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- **Categorical Encoding & Missing Value Handling**: Imputed missing *Total Charges* using *Tenure Months* and *Monthly Charges*.
- **Feature Transformation**: Converted *Tenure Months* into categorical bins for better interpretability.
- **Feature Selection**: Removed redundant features (*CustomerID, Country, State, Churn Score, CLTV*).
- **Data Balancing**: Addressed **class imbalance** using **Synthetic Data Generation (SMOTE or similar techniques)**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Models
- **Logistic Regression**: Simple and interpretable for binary classification.
- **Random Forest**: Handles high-dimensional data efficiently.
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**: Boosts predictive performance and reduces bias.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Suitable for pattern recognition in customer data.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Effective for complex decision boundaries.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deep Learning Models
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**: Captures intricate customer behavior patterns.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Used for automatic feature extraction.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Unsupervised Learning for Customer Segmentation
- **K-Means Clustering & K-Medoids**: Identifies distinct customer groups.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Provides insights into customer segment structures.
- **Cluster Validation Metrics**: Applied **Silhouette, Elbow, and Gap Statistics** to determine optimal cluster count.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation Metrics
- **Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score** for classification assessment.
- **AUC-ROC Curve** to evaluate model discrimination ability.

## üéØ Business Impact & Applications
‚úÖ **Predictive modeling** enables proactive customer retention strategies.
‚úÖ **Segmented marketing campaigns** improve customer engagement.
‚úÖ **Churn analysis insights** help optimize telecom service offerings.
